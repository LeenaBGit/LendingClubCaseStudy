# Lending Club Case Study
Lending Club is a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to customers. 
If the company approves the loan for an applicant who is not likely to repay the loan, it will cause a financial loss for the company. 
However, if the company doesn’t approve the loan for an applicant who is likely to repay the loan, it will result in a loss of business.
As such it is vital to identify risky loan applicants
